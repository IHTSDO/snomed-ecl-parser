# How to generate ANTLR4 grammar from ABNF

See https://github.com/IHTSDO/snomed-scg-parser/blob/master/parser-generation/README.md to generate ANTLR4 from the ABNF grammar file. Name the generated file `ECL.g4` and copy the file to the directory `src/main/antlr4/org/snomed/langauges/ecl/generated/parser/`.

In order to allow non-english language characters, the following lexer rule needs to be manually added to the `ECL.g4` file (borrowed from the ANTLR4 lexer, https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/antlr4/LexBasic.g4):

```
UTF8_LETTER 
   : '\u00C0' .. '\u02FF'
   | '\u0370' .. '\u037D'
   | '\u037F' .. '\u1FFF'
   | '\u200C' .. '\u200D'
   | '\u2070' .. '\u218F'
   | '\u2C00' .. '\u2FEF'
   | '\u3001' .. '\uD7FF'
   | '\uF900' .. '\uFDCF'
   | '\uFDF0' .. '\uFFFD'
   ;
```

Also, the following lines should be removed, if present:

```
utf8_2 : (U_00C2 | U_00C3 | U_00C4 | U_00C5 | U_00C6 | U_00C7 | U_00C8 | U_00C9 | U_00CA | U_00CB | U_00CC | U_00CD | U_00CE | U_00CF | U_00D0 | U_00D1 | U_00D2 | U_00D3 | U_00D4 | U_00D5 | U_00D6 | U_00D7 | U_00D8 | U_00D9 | U_00DA | U_00DB | U_00DC | U_00DD | U_00DE | U_00DF) utf8_tail;

utf8_4 : (U_00F0 (U_0090 | U_0091 | U_0092 | U_0093 | U_0094 | U_0095 | U_0096 | U_0097 | U_0098 | U_0099 | U_009A | U_009B | U_009C | U_009D | U_009E | U_009F | U_00A0 | U_00A1 | U_00A2 | U_00A3 | U_00A4 | U_00A5 | U_00A6 | U_00A7 | U_00A8 | U_00A9 | U_00AA | U_00AB | U_00AC | U_00AD | U_00AE | U_00AF | U_00B0 | U_00B1 | U_00B2 | U_00B3 | U_00B4 | U_00B5 | U_00B6 | U_00B7 | U_00B8 | U_00B9 | U_00BA | U_00BB | U_00BC | U_00BD | U_00BE | U_00BF) ( utf8_tail ) (utf8_tail)) | ((U_00F1 | U_00F2 | U_00F3) ( utf8_tail ) (utf8_tail) (utf8_tail)) | (U_00F4 (U_0080 | U_0081 | U_0082 | U_0083 | U_0084 | U_0085 | U_0086 | U_0087 | U_0088 | U_0089 | U_008A | U_008B | U_008C | U_008D | U_008E | U_008F) ( utf8_tail ) (utf8_tail));

```

Then, all instances of `utf8_2`, `utf8_3`, `utf8_4`, and `utf8_tail` should be replaced with `UTF8_LETTER`. E.g.:
```
nonwsnonpipe : (EXCLAMATION | QUOTE | POUND | DOLLAR | PERCENT | AMPERSAND | APOSTROPHE | LEFT_PAREN | RIGHT_PAREN | ASTERISK | PLUS | COMMA | DASH | PERIOD | SLASH | ZERO | ONE | TWO | THREE | FOUR | FIVE | SIX | SEVEN | EIGHT | NINE | COLON | SEMICOLON | LESS_THAN | EQUALS | GREATER_THAN | QUESTION | AT | CAP_A | CAP_B | CAP_C | CAP_D | CAP_E | CAP_F | CAP_G | CAP_H | CAP_I | CAP_J | CAP_K | CAP_L | CAP_M | CAP_N | CAP_O | CAP_P | CAP_Q | CAP_R | CAP_S | CAP_T | CAP_U | CAP_V | CAP_W | CAP_X | CAP_Y | CAP_Z | LEFT_BRACE | BACKSLASH | RIGHT_BRACE | CARAT | UNDERSCORE | ACCENT | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | LEFT_CURLY_BRACE) | (RIGHT_CURLY_BRACE | TILDE) | utf8_2 | utf8_3 | utf8_4;
```
...becomes...
```

```
Finally, all instances of `U_00xx : '\u00xx';` lexer rules can be deleted.
